                    <p class="colum-textpresent"> When we ran our Kickstater campaign, raising $25,000 was a pretty big deal. Now if you don’t hit $100,000 you’re a nobody, and if you don’t amass $1,000,000 you’re not worth blogging about. Crowdfunding went supernova and digital publishing, too, has shifted from a niche backwater to very soon becoming the way most books are sold.1 While it’s easy to see the material changes produced from crowd funding, some of the transitions, foibles and triumphs in publishing might be less obvious.</p>

The entire book is there. All the interviews, essays and art space information. Everything has an address to which you can point. <br> Why do this? I strongly believe digital books benefit from public endpoints. The current generation of readers (human, not electronic) have formed expectations about sharing text, and if you obstruct their ability to share — to touch — digital text, then your content is as good as non-existent. Or, in the least, it’s less likely to be engaged.<sup>3</sup> <br> I also believe that we will sell more digital and physical copies of "Art Space Tokyo" by having all of the content available online. The number of inbound links to the site should increase exponentially. read.artspacetokyo.com is one of the largest collections of publicly available text about the Tokyo art world online. Organic search traffic should increase accordingly, and by having upsells on every page, the conversion to paid users should follow suit. We'll report back with numbers in time.</p>

                        <p class="blocktextpresent">When we announced an ‘iPad edition,’ we made a very conscious decision not to say ‘iPad application. <br> Think back: In May 2010, the iPad had just been released. The landscape for publishing on the iPad was nonexistent and we had lots of reservations about books-as-apps as the correct model. It seemed overly complex, especially for a book originally conceived of as a printed object. So at the time we decided to focus on the physical part of the Kickstarter campaign — update, print, and redistribute the clothbound, hardcover edition.</p>
                        <p class="blocktextpresent">It took a few months of full-time work but we shipped the books. They looked great. Our backers were happy. We then spent a month taking all the knowledge gained during the campaign and gave the community a full post-mortem: Kickstartup. Kickstarter even gave us a ‘Best in Show: Post-Mortem’ award which made us smile.</p>

                        <p class="blocktextpresent">Fall of 2010 arrived and the more we looked into developing a custom app for "Art Space Tokyo", the less rational it seemed. Even ‘simple’ apps are hard. Really hard.5 And whether simple or complex, almost no one was doing it.<br>By this time, several major publishing houses had released magazine applications. Wired, Popular Science, and The New Yorker were among the first few. They were disappointing. The text was images. The file sizes huge. The download process for each issue was awkward. They weren’t friendly to screen readers. This certainly didn’t feel like the right direction for digital reading, never mind our humble "Art Space Tokyo".</p>
                        <div class="span-column">
                        <p class="blocktextpresent">To worsen matters, the navigation was confusing — each application a little different. The clarity of physical magazine usability — ‘just keep swiping’ — was lost in an effort to ‘innovate on’ and shoe-horn print workflows into a digital box. The apps just didn’t work.</p>
                        <p class="blocktextpresent">In fact, the more we looked at these frankenstinian magazines, the more we realized that a PDF would be a better solution. A PDF would at least be made of ‘real text.’ It would be inherently searchable. It would compress well. Navigation would be consistent: Just. Keep. Swiping.<sup>6</sup>.</p>

Even today, the hardware eink Kindle is one of my favorite pieces of technology. It’s one of the most quiet tech objects I own.<sup>8</sup> It gets out of the way when reading, has worldwide cellular connectivity, and the battery lasts nearly forever. It’s magic.</p>
                            <p class="blocktextpresent">IMy attention was captured by these two pieces of technology: iBooks coupled with EPUB3, and the elegance of hardware Kindles coupled with the promise of their Kindle ecosystem.</p>

It would generally come to feel much more design-friendly than Kindle. On the other hand, Kindle would establish itself as a true reading platform with cross-device integration, a web presence, social reading hooks, and innovative lending and sharing capabilities.</p>

You have less control over the visual language of your book (in the case of non-Fire Kindle devices, almost no control).</p>
                            <p class="blocktextpresent">For some books, these disadvantages are showstoppers. And if you have a book that’s breaking the way stories are told, then by all means make an app.<sub>11</sub> But "Art Space Tokyo" is a pretty “normal” book. It was written with a classic print ethos in mind. The structure is, if not explicitly linear, then well defined. And any “interactivity” can be augmented with links to external resources.<sub>12</sub> In our case, the advantages of the iBooks and Kindle platforms outweighed the inherent disadvantages. And far far outweighed the disadvantages of designing, engineering, and maintaining a standalone application.</p></div>
