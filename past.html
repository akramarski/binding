                        <p class="blocktext">To quote the Slovenian artist Vuk Ćosić (one of the pioneers of net. art), an essential question may well be: Is a hard copy obsolete?<sup>73</sup> This was the title of an essay which Ćosić published in the late 1990s on the subject of networked art a title which itself provocatively questions the human attachment to the tangible, in contrast with the development of various new communication strategies in networked environments. A decade later, we can say with certainty that print has not (yet) become obsolete. But it does seem to be in a period of profound mutation, mainly because of how the electronic screen is already taking over several of the functions of paper. This transitional phase has been predicted ever since the early days of the Web, and was described as being in effect the “Late Age of Print” by Jay David Bolter in his book Writing Space.<sup>74</sup> Whenever it seems that a newer, more powerful technology is about to change the established rules of a system, then that entire system tends to gradually produce a counter-reaction. In the 1940s for example, when the introduction of the first facsimile machine prototypes was sending waves of apprehension throughout the newspaper industry, the Canadian Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences wrote in a report to its members.</p>

Participating users were especially enthusiastic about the possibility of copy-pasting news content. In a KRON-TV news report on this experiment, the reporter Steve Newman imagined the future: </p>

            <p id="description"> Which goes to show just how radically the economics of the ‘tele-paper’ have changed since then (and particularly since the mid-00s).
                In February 2007, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of the New York Times, announced:  </p>
            <p id="description-page"> “I really don’t know whether we’ll be printing the Times in five years, and you know what? I don’t care either.”<sup>77</sup> </p>

                <p class="blocktext">This statement was more or less instantly quoted (and endlessly repeated) by online news media platforms of every kind, seeing here a sign from God that their dream of many years was finally materialising. But what Sulzberger was actually saying was that within five years, the New York Times would be ready to switch to a digital-only business model. And yet just one year later, the plummeting of circulation and ads sales, combined with the economic crisis, would force a number of historically significant mid-sized U.S. newspapers (some of which had been publishing for more than a century) to stop printing – in some cases switching to a web-only format. These included the Seattle Post-Intelligencer,<sup>78</sup> the Christian Science Monitor,<sup>79</sup> the Capital Times,<sup>80</sup> the Ann Arbor News,<sup>81</sup> the Rocky Mountain News,<sup>82</sup> and the Tucson Citizen.<sup>83</sup> Others have cut down the number of editions to only a few days each week, or re-sorted to a free-distribution business model (such as the Evening  Standard in the U.K.<sup>84</sup>) in order to maintain their circulation figures. And a number of iconic world newspapers, such as the New York Times and the San Francisco Chronicle, are barely surviving, chronically seek-ing injections of new capital to help them survive beyond their current print-based business model. And the vultures are quickly circling in. Marc Andreessen (founder of Netscape, and now on the board of both EBay and Facebook) publicly assessed the situation in these harsh terms:  </p>

The exhibition featured artworks which have examined, questioned, and made use of newspapers since the 1960s; here the newspaper comes across as an object and a medium whose aesthetic status seems to belong to some undefined past, rather than to the present.And what does Google, which enjoys a near-monopoly of the online search market, have to say about the problems currently facing news-papers? Eric Schmidt, Google’s CEO, replied in an interview:</p>

These little things help, but they don’t fundamentally solve the problem.”<sup>89</sup></p>

            <p id="description"> Meanwhile, Google’s current business model of cashing in (through its online services such as Google News) on free news published by other sites, is increasingly being called into question by traditional editors. Robert Thomson, an editor of the Wall Street Journal, indignantly characterised such content aggregators as “parasites or tech tape-worms in the intestines of the Internet”.90 But it’s clear that the price of information has dropped. As Clay Shirky, Assistant Arts Professor at New York University’s graduate Interactive Telecommunications Program, anticipated in 1995: </p>
