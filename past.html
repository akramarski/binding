A decade later, we can say with certainty that print has not (yet) become obsolete. But it does seem to be in a period of profound mutation, mainly because of how the electronic screen is already taking over several of the functions of paper. This transitional phase has been predicted ever since the early days of the Web, and was described as being in effect the “Late Age of Print” by Jay David Bolter in his book Writing Space.<sup>74</sup> Whenever it seems that a newer, more powerful technology is about to change the established rules of a system, then that entire system tends to gradually produce a counter-reaction. In the 1940s for example, when the introduction of the first facsimile machine prototypes was sending waves of apprehension throughout the newspaper industry, the Canadian Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences wrote in a report to its members.</p>
